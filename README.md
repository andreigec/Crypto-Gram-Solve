Crypto-Solve
============

CryptoGramSolve(CGS) is an application that solves cryptograms.
Cryptograms are "substitution ciphers", where each character is replaced with another. It does not matter which character, as long as similar character have the same substitution.
For example, rabbit would encode into 123345/abccde/pxllhe.
It is also possible for collisions to occur, for example 1234 may refer to dogs or bags or hags etc.
CGS performs both decryption to plain text, as well as encryption to a cryptogram.
